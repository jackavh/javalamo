Researched some of the different dataset options and found that Cornell's Movie Corpus is not a good fit for this project. The corpus is broken into multiple convoluded .json files that would be headache inducing to format into a good training set. After considering other options, I found the **WikiQACorpus** and decided this is a much better fit. This corpus contains question/answer pairs across a wide range of subjects, and is already formatted in some .tsv files which will be much easier to parse for the project. In addition, the data was generated to specifically used for NLP projects, so this dataset is the best fit

Got the dev environment ready, and set up Maven to manage Deeplearning4J and other dependencies as they pop up. In the background I am researching with a two pronged approach. On one end, I am reading and re-reading the Transformer paper, "Attention is All You Need," while trying my best to understand the super complex technical jargon. On the other end, I am watching a nice lecture series by Andrej Karpathy building from the ground up, very intuitive and simple. I am finding that the eureka moments are abundant with this method. Finally, I am reading through relevant pages of the Deeplearning4J documentation to get some understanding of future implementations.
